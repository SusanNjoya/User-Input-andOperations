# User-Input-andOperations-lab1
Program 1: The user is prompted to input n. n is the number of times we check if an integer is divisible by 10 or 15.

Program 2: This program uses a loop to read the radius of a circle and print its diameter, area, and circumference.

Program 3: This program exits when a negative number is entered. The program prints the average of all the numbers input by the user.

Program 4: This program takes two user inputs and squares them. It then adds the squares and prints the sum. 

Program 5: This program uses a method that takes a string as an input. It then outputs the number of integers in the string, the sum of all the numbers when added, and the average of all the numbers.

Program 6: This program reads the content of a text file and outputs the total of the numbers found in the file. It also outputs the largest number in each line as well as the average numbers in each line. Once all the outputs are completed they are then printed onto another different text file. 

Program 7: This program assigns 10 user inputs into an array. Using multiple methods the program then outputs the integers entered in the array, the average of the integers, the lowest and highest integers, as well as a comparison of the integers. The program also allows users to use a menu to choose which method is being implemented.

Program 8: This program prints the contents of an array in the reverse order. 

Program 9: This program uses a method that takes user input from 1-12 and prints out its corresponding day of the month.

Program 10: This program uses a method to determine if each user input is even or odd.
